    "\n",
    "*Support Vector Machine:*\n",
    "\n",
    "Real world application: Support Vector Machines are often used in image recognition problems, like [diagnosing plant diseases based on images of leaves](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqcKaZXhLEE).\n",
    "\n",
    "Strengths: The algorithm is effective in high-dimensional spaces, even when the number of dimensions exceeds the number of data points. It's also memory efficient, since it utilizes only the subset of data points near the decision boundary.\n",
    "\n",
    "Weaknesses: Support Vector Machines are good for classification, but not great for regression, which is much more computationally expensive.\n",
    "\n",
    "Justification: Support Vector Machines are good for classification problems with large numbers of features compared to their number of data points, which is the case here. It would also give us more leeway to add features in the future to predict outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Logistic Regression:*\n",
    "\n",
    "Real world application: Logistic Regression can be used by college admissions offices to [predict if admitted students will decide to attend](http://www.math.montana.edu/grad/writing-projects/09sulock.pdf).\n",
    "\n",
    "Strengths: Logistic regression is one of the oldest and most widely-used algorithms, so it's widely understood and well supported. It easily gives probabilities in addition to strict binary classification. It also makes fewer assumptions about distribution of data than other algorithms, so it's more robust to irregular data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Weaknesses: Logistic Regression typically requires more data points than other algorithms to converge to stable, meaningful results.\n",
    "\n",
    "Justification: Logistic Regression is very good at giving probabilities of certain students dropping out, which is also very useful in deciding who needs extra help.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Gaussian Naive Bayes:*\n",
    " \n",
    "Real world application: Naive Bayes classifiers are often used in [email spam filtering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naive_Bayes_spam_filtering).\n",
    "\n",
    "Strengths: Naive Bayes is simple and easy to implement, with few parameters to adjust. It's also fast to train and predict, and has been shown to be successful in many different applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "Weakness: Naive Bayes assumes that there are no interrelationships between features (meaning that they're all statistically independent), so results can be skewed if there's a high correlation between some features (however, in practice this doesn't matter too much).\n",
    "\n",
    "Justification for using it: Naive Bayes has a good empirical success rate with binary classification problems, and given its simplicity, ease of use, and efficiency, it's worth trying."

    "With the predefined functions above, you will now import the three supervised learning models of your choice and run the `train_predict` function for each one. Remember that you will need to train and predict on each classifier for three different training set sizes: 100, 200, and 300. Hence, you should expect to have 9 different outputs below — 3 for each model using the varying training set sizes. In the following code cell, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    "- Import the three supervised learning models you've discussed in the previous section.\n",
    "- Initialize the three models and store them in `clf_A`, `clf_B`, and `clf_C`.\n",
    " - Use a `random_state` for each model you use, if provided.\n",
    " - **Note:** Use the default settings for each model — you will tune one specific model in a later section.\n",
    "- Create the different training set sizes to be used to train each model.\n",
    " - *Do not reshuffle and resplit the data! The new training points should be drawn from `X_train` and `y_train`.*\n",
    "- Fit each model with each training set size and make predictions on the test set (9 in total).  \n",
