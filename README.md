# Udacity Machine Learning Nanodegree
# Project #2: Student Intervention

## Introduction
This is a project for Udacity's Machine-Learning Nanodegree. It uses supervised learning algorithms to identify students at risk of dropping out of school.


## Concepts and Classes
Concepts explored in this project:

  - Supervised learning algorithms like support vector machines, logistic regression, and naive bayes
  - Evaluation metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score
  - Parameter optimization using grid search

Relevant Classes:
